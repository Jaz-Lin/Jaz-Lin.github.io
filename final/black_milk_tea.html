                    While the origins of boba tea are unclear, it’s thought to have originated in Taiwan sometime around the 1980s. 
                    <ul class="description-text">
                        <li>One possible origin was that it was created by Liu Han Chien in Taichung City in Taiwain, who initially combined milk tea and black tapioca balls - it became a popular drink with students who would buy it from street vendors. </li>
                        <li>Another claim of creation comes from the owner of Hanlin Tea Room of Tainan City in Taiwan.Tu Tsong-he’s idea was to create something new that would become popular among those who wanted something different from drinking the traditionally made tea.</li>
