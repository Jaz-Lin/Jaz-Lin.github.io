                    This drink is typically enjoyed as a thicker and creamier beverage than other flavors of milk tea - it comes in many variations and can be made up with different ingredients. Certain shops will prepare the drink with strawberry-flavored milk tea powder 
                    while others prepare it with fresh strawberries. As typical, it starts out with a milk base and some strawberry flavoring of a kind is added in to give the beverage its bright pink coloring. And of course, with the many variations of the drink, there's different 
                    customizations that can be added and changed to your liking.
