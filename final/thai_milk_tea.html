                    At its base, thai iced tea starts out with a strong flavor of black tea. Once brewed, condensed milk is added. Generally speaking, tea is a new commodity in Thailand, having arrived from China around the 1980s.
                    It's thought that the invention of thai iced tea originated from a Thai leader who had interest in Western culture - once it was created, it beacame popular to be served alongside stree food. Fun fact: while thai iced 
                    tea is a bright orange color, part of that brightness comes from added food coloring (to appeal more to consumers).
