							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> 
								I think overall, it ties nicely together the two ideas focused on the article - psychology and UX. I'm not sure if it exactly influenced my opinion in a specific way, rather, it seemed more informational about how it's important to take into consideration 
								attention as a UX designer. More so, it brings attention to different types of attention and how we might want to reduce cognitive overload when designing some kind of interface. I think the really cool examples were them talking about the examples under cognitive resource, 
								specifically the cockktail party effect and how it presented some visualizations to see the examples in action.

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 8. It wraps psychology and UX together nicely and I think it does a good job breaking down the core concepts of different types of attention and examples of what cognitive overload might look like and how to reduce it a little. </p>
