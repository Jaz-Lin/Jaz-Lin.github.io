					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p>Krave Beauty</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/My_Wireframe.png">
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The main goal of the website is to sell its products, specifically skincare products. It's target demographic is towards those of the younger generation, given it's more artsy and brightful website design as well as those who 
								are looking for something more simple to incorporate into their skincare routine. The design of the website tries to showcase each of its products and different combinations of the product you can use. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> At least for the redesign, the main thing I changed was emphasis, such that the core product should be more emphasized than other products becaues this particular brand is known 
								for that specific product (especially when they first started out). Since a lot of the target demographic are looking for something more simple, their eshould be more emphasis placed on their flagship products to cater to those 
								people. In addition, I removed the Shop All button since there's an option for that by using the menu tabs at the top left of the page. 
							 </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
