						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article was the amount of effort and thought that goes into selecting a font for some kind of design. Not only do you have to consider your target demographic, but you also want to consider how one font might also work 
								with another type of font. One of the more surprising things I learned was that in selecting font size, there are certain ratios that you might want to consider (and it's really cool that math can also be integrated into typography!). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>One of my favorite parts of this article was the amount of guides and resources that they linked for the reader to try. Whenever you're introducing something new, it's going to be difficult to figure how to get started, so it's really good that the article provides
								plenty of resources for the reader. I also enjoyed the many examples given in the article that showcase each topic that the author introduced.
