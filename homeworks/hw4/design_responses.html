						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting that I learned from this article was mainly how to make a product color-accessible. More specifically, I learned about the motivation behind making a product color-accessible 
								and some different ways to ensure that type of accessibility. For example, the article covered how you may not necessarily want to solely rely on color to convey a message and that it might be good 
								to incorporate some type of icongraphy to ensure that as much people are able to understand the intent of a design choice.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Overall, it was a well written article - it was concise with its explanations and provided good design examples of what to do and what not to do when complying with 
								color accessibility. While the examples were very thoughtful, one of my favorite parts about this article is explaining why it's important to have your website be color 
								accessible. If there is no motivation behind the design choices, then there isn't any reason to really implement it, which is why it's important the article covered the reason 
								behind making something color accessible.
