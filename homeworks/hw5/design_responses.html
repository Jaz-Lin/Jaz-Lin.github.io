                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something that I learned in this article is the variation in UI interactions and animations and how different designers choose to display interactions in their design. Every designer has their own perspective on how a user might use and interact with their product, and based on that perspective, they decide to integrate certain choices and animations in their design to cater 
                                to whatever they think works best, and I think it's cool to be able to see the choices that each designer made. On top of that, I'm able to see how different designers, well, design their product - their layout, color scheme, the placement of different components, etc. Overall, it gave a good source of inspiration and ideas that I could integrate in any of my future designs. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Because there wasn't any text in the article, it mainly relied on GIFs and showing what animation shows up when the user interacts with the design in a specific way. I think it's a really cool way 
                                to let the designs speak for themselves and showcase decisions that the designer made when they thought about how the user would use and interact with their product. So one of my favorite parts about this article 
                                is just enjoying the designs and being able to observe and take in the choices made by different designers.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> One of my favorite inspirations is the design with the subtitle of: "Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde" (the phone interface that showcases a description of a Nike show and the user interacting with the app by pulling out a menu from the right). I think this 
                                particular example is just very satisfying in a way - the color scheme is very minimalistic and I enjoy how they chose a single color to use (besides white). The interface is supposed to be showing how a user might interact with a website when they're buying shoes and 
                                it provides all the needed information and options for ths user, specifically the option to pull out a menu to customize the color and size of the shoe they are purchasing. One of the main things that really stood out is their emphasis on the customization menu, where the menu "bounces" out 
                                when the user pull it out, and it's very unique instead of using a more "rigid" interaction.
