							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, the author ended up covering a variety of different types of interactions that users might expect when they're using some sort of interface. I ended up learning a lot about animation and different components of animation that one should 
								pay attention to when designing it. For example, the article covered about how duration and speed affects the seamlessness of an animation and depending on the size of the screen, it might be good to adjust certain aspects to account for the user's perspective. 
							Another thing that was covered was overall differences between a good animation and a bad animation and it helps to solidfy why there are certain things that you might not want to do.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed all parts of the article, but I really liked how the author covered equal interaction. I think that's something that I really didn't know too much about in comparison with other topics that were covered in the article. I really enjoyed how there were snippets of the animation 
								for each subpart and it went into detail about the somtimes subtle differences if one rule were to be broken. I particular enjoyed the zig-zag example that they gave for the tabular view, espeecially since there's just a somewhat huge difference of how one reveals elements and its overall impact.
