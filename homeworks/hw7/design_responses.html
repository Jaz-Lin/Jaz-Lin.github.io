					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The Gestalt principles and their applications in UI design! More specifically, I learned about how the Gestalt principles can influence our design choices and how we deicide to rearrange and structure elements on our user interface. For a large amount 
								of examples that were given in the article, the idea seemed familiar and something that I've noticed when looking at a few designs, but it didn't become entirely formalized until after reading this article. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Considering what the Gestalt principles are, I'm really glad that they showed an example of the principles themselves, but also what they may look like in UI designs. This helps a lot in formalizing a bit more on what the Gestalt principles are and how they can be applied. Another thing that I did particular enjoy was the varying color scheme 
								for differing examples - I just found this really nice as it associated a variety of colors with differing examples.
