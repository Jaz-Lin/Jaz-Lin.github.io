						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> It's very interesting that the this point was brought up: that dark patterns are much more complex and subtle than they were in the early days of the Internet. At least how dark pattern design is defined, my default expectation is that 
							its some kind of random (shady) pop-up or fine print that companies might add in to hope that users don't notice any unfavorable conditions. But it's a good point to bring up that it's expanded a bit far beyond than what we might have expected,
							and this includes some of the ways dark pattern design appears as mentioned in the article and really what the intention some of the practices might be (and how to avoid them).  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> A lot of the examples that were brought up when talking about dark practices were very relatable, in the sense that it's something that we might have noticed when browsing on the web, but didn't really have a name on it. For example, seeing the example of disguised 
							ads is pretty relatable because it's something that appears a lot when I'm trying to download something for free or maybe do a free file conversion (like png to pdf). I really enjoy how the article brings awareness to these types of issues and also offers more positive,
							impactful alternatives that can replace the dark patterns.

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Despite these possible solutions, there is still a gap. It is the designerâ€™s moral code. The implications of the products they create needs to be considered." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> 8 (There are a lot of examples that they give about some common dark patterns and it leaves a really strong impression that there's something that we can do about the issue.) </p>
